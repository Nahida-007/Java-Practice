1.a java program can contain any number of class 
but atmost one class need to be declared as public

2.only one public class is allowed

3.if there is no public class u can take any name to save the java program 
class A
{
}
class B
{
}
class C
{
}
class D

4.if there is one public classs we need to save program with same name
{
}
public class B
{
}
class C
{
}
class D
{
}
5.if a program have multiple main method then we can save with any class name because it doesn't have public.
class A
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
S.O.P("");
}
class B
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
S.O.P("");
}
class C
{
}
