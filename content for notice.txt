Dear Sir / Madam,

This is a kind of request to you regarding my early relieving from the company.I know that I agreed to the company terms and conditions regarding
the notice period during my joining time.
But there are some situations are making me to write this request letter to reduce my notice period to 30 days from 90 days. Am glad with hike you granted me though 
Because I have some personal family issue and iam getting pressure abou salary.


I promise you that I will finish all the pending works and I will cooperate with you in transferring my duties to other employees.
I hope you understand my situation and expecting a
positive response from your side because it will help me a lot.

Thanking you.
